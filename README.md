# Arduino UNO Project

> The code works on a  medical detector called  Astragalus detector.And the device is based on Arduino UNO.  
> Althon I delete the  algorithm for calculating medical values, you can still learn the way using Arduino to contorl TF Strorage Card/LCD screen/Membrane keyboard/buzzer/LED and so on .
> I have record a video to show the effect.[Arduino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33fNuB9bCAI)

> The sparkling point of the project is using one wire to control an 4Ã—4 keypad.This can save some pin port.The connect way show as below:

> The libray file for one wire to control the keypad is *OnewireKeypad-master.rar*,you can download it and try to run on your Arduino device.  

> The whole project's circuit layout shows as below:

**Hope this can help you.**
